# TXT002: A date in user-visible text that is not ISO (yyyy-MM-dd)
#
# A date written "10/12/2026" means two different days to two readers; "12 Oct" drops the
# year; a format pattern "dd MMM HH:mm" typed into a caption or message template renders
# every row that way. A 2026-10-12 UX-fix run over three apps found non-ISO dates in 2 of 3:
# one app had trail dates in `dd MMM HH:mm` plus a raw `M/d/yyyy`, another `dd MMM` in five
# places. Both apps had a glossary task whose grep listed two patterns and reported "33 of
# 33 already ISO"; two later tasks rewrote the same lines without fixing them. Both misses
# were found only by a read-only final review (issue #280).
#
# What it flags, in every user-visible string strings() returns (same scope as TXT001):
#   - a literal date not in ISO order: 10/12/2026, 1-2-2026, 12.10.2026, 12 Oct 2026,
#     Oct 12, 2026
#   - a date FORMAT pattern with day and month adjacent in non-ISO order: dd MMM, MM/dd,
#     d/M/yy, dd-MM-yyyy. The ISO forms yyyy-MM-dd and yyyy-MM are removed before matching,
#     so "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm" passes.
# One finding per text element and pattern kind, all languages folded into one.
#
# Deliberately NOT read — say this out loud, it is the larger half of the incident: format
# strings inside EXPRESSIONS (formatDateTime($d, 'dd MMM HH:mm') in a microflow, a CHANGE
# that writes a date into an audit text). The catalog does not index expression literals, so
# this rule cannot see them; see process/lint-backlog.md for the blocked row. Nor does it see
# a DateTime attribute rendered with the locale's default format — that is a widget format
# setting, not a string.
#
# ISO dates are a toolkit opinion, not a Mendix rule. If this project's display standard is
# deliberately not ISO, that is the user's decision (asked in chat, recorded in PROJECT.md):
# set `rules: TXT002: enabled: false` in .claude/lint-config.yaml, and optionally list this file
# with a `# reason:` in .claude/lint-rules-disabled.txt so sync stops installing it. Never
# delete or loosen this file (lint-rules/README.md "Opting out of a rule").
#
# REQUIRES mxcli >= 0.25.0 (the strings() builtin) and a FULL catalog. On an older binary
# this file does not load at all — mxcli prints "rule file skipped" on stderr and no `_rule`
# finding is possible, so pin the binary. Vocabulary probed 2026-10-13, mxcli 0.26.0 — see the TXT001 header; same fields, same contexts. When pages
# exist and strings() returns nothing, or nothing it returns is user-visible, the rule says
# so with a `_rule` finding instead of reporting a clean pass.
