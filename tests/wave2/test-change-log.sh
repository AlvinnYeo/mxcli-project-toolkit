#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test-change-log.sh — the PROJECT.md "## Change log" (skills/change-intake.md): init writes it,
# sync appends it once to an older project, gate-check counts what it owes as WARN and never blocks,
# and exec.sh's --cr tag lands in the BUILD-LOG detail cell.
#
# Usage: bash tests/wave2/test-change-log.sh bin/gate-check.sh
#
# GOLDEN INPUT IS THE REAL SCAFFOLD. Every PROJECT.md here is written by the real
# bin/init-project.sh; rows are appended under the table header that init itself wrote, never
# into a hand-typed register. A "pre-change-log" project is the real scaffold with the section
# cut out — exactly what a project scaffolded before this section existed looks like.
#
#   T1  init writes the section: heading, legend, the 9-column header, no rows
#   T2  scan counts: open/refined/agreed pending, applied/proven with no Closed-by, unknown status,
#       rejected and evidenced rows not owed; escaped pipe kept; comment + other-section rows ignored
#   T3  gate-check prints "Change log: WARN — 3 of 8 …" and lists the owed rows
#   T4  WARN never blocks: exit codes of a full run and of a Stage 5 query are identical with and
#       without owed rows
#   T5  all rows closed → PASS line naming the count
#   T6  no section → WARN naming sync-project.sh, still not blocking
#   T7  sync appends the section to an older project exactly once; second run writes nothing;
#       --dry-run writes nothing
#   T8  exec.sh --cr: a malformed id is refused (exit 2) before anything needs a project; a
#       well-formed one passes through to --change-class; the BUILD-LOG detail carries "cr:"
#   T9  CRLF PROJECT.md (saved on Windows): the section is found, the scan and the gate line
#       match the LF copy exactly, and sync does not append a second section
