#
# test-obligation-final-look.sh — the `final-look` row in bin/lib/obligations.tsv: one whole-app
# LOOK report, owed last, re-owed after any later model commit.
#
# WHY (#283): on a 20-task UX-fix run over three apps (2026-10-12) a later task undid an earlier
# status fix on four pages. Every per-task review passed; only a read-only whole-app LOOK, run
# after the last task, found it — and nothing owed that pass. The row makes it owed; "final" is
# enforced by the existing VALID AT rule (_ob_stale), not by new code.
#
# Review of #303 (2026-10-13), T4-T10: the final LOOK owes the same PROOF-OF-LOOK lines as the
# per-module LOOK (module-review.md § "The final LOOK" requires them; only ob=look was checked);
# an unstamped final report is FAULT (with no VALID AT it could never go stale, so it would pass
# forever); and final-look (ONLY) is NOT YET DUE until gate-check's DERIVED Current stage
# reaches 6. A hand-written or scaffold stage line is unreadable → owed; every other row keeps
# its verdict (review of #321: hand-written lines disagree with the gates in 8 of 12 projects).
# Subject: obligation-check.sh. Producer of the report: module-review.md § "The final LOOK".
