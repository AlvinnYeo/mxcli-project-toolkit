# The "## Change log" section of a project's PROJECT.md — ONE copy of its template and ONE parser.
#
# init-project.sh writes the empty section, sync-project.sh appends it to a project that predates
# it, and gate-check.sh reads it back. Same one-copy arrangement as intake-template.sh and
# ritual-template.sh: two hand-kept copies of a template have drifted before.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS (2026-10-13). Across 12 mid-build changes on real projects, 12 went straight into
# MDL and 0 updated a BRD, build plan or wireframe; the drift-sync marker that should have caught
# them was never written once, and its absence is undetectable, so every gate passed on silence.
# The change log makes the ask itself the record: one row per piece of feedback, written BEFORE
# any edit, so "nothing logged" and "logged but never applied" become countable.
# The method is skills/change-intake.md; this file is only the table and its reader.
#
# PRODUCER for the consumer (CLAUDE.md "Shipping an instrument" rule 5): the section is written by
# bin/init-project.sh (every new project) and bin/sync-project.sh (every existing one, after a
# toolkit pull) — both mandatory chain steps. Rows are written by the lead per change-intake.md.
#
# WARN-ONLY. gate-check.sh reports what mxtk_change_log_scan counts as a WARN line and never
# blocks on it. change-intake.md says when that changes, and why not yet.
#
# Sourced, never executed. Callers are `set -euo pipefail`, so keep this side-effect free.

## Change log

Feedback and change requests, one row each, written BEFORE any edit (`skills/change-intake.md`). Status: open → refined → agreed → applied → proven, or rejected (reason); Closed-by cites the commit, journey or test. Escape a `|` inside the ask as `\|`.

| CR | Date | Source | Verbatim ask | Class | Size | Entry artifact | Status | Closed-by |

# Usage: mxtk_change_log_has_section <PROJECT.md>   — rc 0 when the heading is present
mxtk_change_log_has_section() {
  [ -f "$1" ] && grep -qiE '^## +change log *$' "$1"
}

# Usage: mxtk_change_log_scan <PROJECT.md>
# Prints one SUMMARY line, then one ROW line per change request that still owes something:
#   SUMMARY<TAB>total<TAB>open<TAB>refined<TAB>agreed<TAB>no_evidence<TAB>unrecognised
#   ROW<TAB>CR-NN<TAB>status<TAB>what it owes<TAB>first 60 chars of the ask
# Only rows inside the "## Change log" section whose first cell is CR-<digits> count. Cells are
# read from the RIGHT (Status is second-to-last, Closed-by last), so an ask containing an
# unescaped pipe still yields the right status — the ask is the cell people type freely.
# HTML comments are skipped, as gate-check.sh's reg_field does: an example row in a comment must
# never count.
